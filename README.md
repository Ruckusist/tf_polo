Some results: https://zhedongzheng.github.io/
* Siraj is a great source for any work he has previously done with Tensorflow, it will be easy to understand.

* This looks super clean and readable even if it has no comments.

* Another clean setup. looks like this guy, started an account then only worked on this for a couple days then abandoned it. Thanks dude!

* This is a currently in progress project by a University student.

* This is another older abandoned project, but this has the Qlearner implementation taken from the Cartpole game from the OpenAI gym tutorial. I have previously tried to implement this in chess and will do another blog about how important this exercise is, and how it can be transferred to solve many different problems.

* It looks like this person started with the mnist tutorial from Tensorflow and then started making changes from there, is good with comments.

* This is a currently running poloniex bot project, might be good for notes.

* Another currently running poloniex project. This guy has a good idea on how to interact with the api to get results to the screen. This project is ongoing for a few months now and thats also a good sign and its in python. So many of these projects are abandoned, there are sad statistics on the subject of how many github repos are abandoned and out of date.

* Last but surely not least, is Harrison. Pythonprogramming.net, github.com/sentdex. This guy made his start doing stock market analysis freelance and selling his dataset/findings for what i would guess is good money. Im going to link a bunch of his material on the subject of python-stock analysis. As you finish reading this. This link is where you should start, then go back to the top and get through the rest of the reading material before starting this project.
